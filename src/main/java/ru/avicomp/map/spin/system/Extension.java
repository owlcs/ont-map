 * An ONT-AMP API extension.

 * A concrete plugin may provide only ARQ function bodies as optimization for existing {@code MapFunction}s,
 * or a SPARQL-based functions without java implementation,
 * or both - a SPIN description and an ARQ implementation.
 * To make it workable an implementation class-path must be added into
