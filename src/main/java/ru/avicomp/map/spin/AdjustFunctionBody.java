/**
 * A common interface that allows accepting {@link MapFunction} arguments directly into a function body.
 * Usually arguments go into a function-call expression,
 * but sometimes it is not enough due to SPIN limitation and
 * to achieve desired function behaviour it is need to modify a function body itself in runtime.
 * This mechanism serves for such a purpose:
 * before the execution of a function, the arguments from the expression (function-call) fall directly
 * into the function body with the help of this class implementation,
 * than function is re-registered and executed while inference.
