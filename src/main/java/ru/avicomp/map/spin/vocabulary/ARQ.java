/**
 * The vocabulary for ARQ functions.
 * The namespace is deprecated, but it is used by spin-family (see {@code file://resources/etc/functions-afn.ttl}),
 * so we can either put up with it, or create our own library with the same functions but with minor customization changes.
 * The second way is easier.
 * Customization is delegated to AVC library (see file://resources/etc/avc.spin.ttl, ontology https://github.com/avicomp/spin).
